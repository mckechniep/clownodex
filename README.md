# Clownodex

Everyone wants to live a happy life. For many of us, our happiness is the most important measure of our lives.  

In an effort to determine exactly what the predictors are of a happy life, Harvard University conducted one of the world's longest and most thorough studies.

 After 80 years of research, the answer was found to be simple:

> **Having positive relationships with others is the key to a happy life.**

Our relationships are *the single most important factor influencing our happiness* - far more so than career achievements, money, and status.

Personally, I have found this to be true. I have led a happy life and that's because I've been exceedingly fortunate to have some great people in my life. 

However, I noticed that it is not always easy to consistently maintain relationships with the people I value. Modern life can be highly transient - at least mine has been - and I have friends scattered across the globe.

The fast-paced nature of life, and the never-ending distractions, also make it difficult to maintain friendships. A famous British anthropologist, Robin Dunbar, has found that 150 people is the maximum number we can maintain meaningful relationships.

So I came up with the Clownodex to help me.

> The Clownodex is a simple tool to help you stay connected with the people who art important to you.

The name is a play on the word "Rolodex" (which is a device used to store and organize business cards), and "clowns" being a nod to a friend and fellow soldier I served with, who replied "I miss the clowns but not the circus" when asked whether he missed the Army.
